Variable:-
----------------------------------------------
In Python, a variable is a symbolic name that you assign to store data. It acts as a container to hold values that can be used and manipulated in your code. 
For example:

python
x = 10  # Here, 'x' is the variable and 10 is the value assigned to it.
name = "Rajdip"  # A variable 'name' storing a string value.
is_active = True  # A variable storing a boolean value.
Python variables are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare their type. The type is determined automatically based on the value assigned.

You can use variables for various purposes, like storing numbers, strings, lists, or even more complex data types.

Data Types:-
----------------------------------------------
Python supports a variety of data types, allowing you to work with different kinds of values. Here's an overview of the main ones:

1. Numeric Types
int: For integers (e.g., 10, -5).

float: For floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.7).

complex: For complex numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g., 3 + 2j).

2. Sequence Types
str: For strings (e.g., "Hello, Rajdip").

list: A mutable sequence of items (e.g., [1, 2, 3]).

tuple: An immutable sequence (e.g., (4, 5, 6)).

3. Set Types
set: An unordered collection of unique items (e.g., {1, 2, 3}).

frozenset: Like a set, but immutable.

4. Mapping Type
dict: A collection of key-value pairs (e.g., {"name": "Rajdip", "age": 25}).

5. Boolean Type
bool: For True or False values.

6. Binary Types
bytes: Immutable sequence of bytes.

bytearray: Mutable sequence of bytes.

memoryview: Provides a view of memory for binary data.

7. None Type
NoneType: Represents the absence of a value, e.g., None.

Python is dynamically typed, so you don't have to declare the type of a variable—it automatically infers it based on the value you assign.
